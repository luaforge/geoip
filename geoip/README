GeoIP
=====

This Lua binding provides access to the most important functions of libGeoIP,
a C library to query the database files produced by MaxMind [1].  Basically
these data files map an IP address to a location or other information.


Installation
------------

The easiest way is to build and/or install this module as Lua Rock.  When
you have the *.rockspec file, do this:

   luarocks install geoip

This won't work yet as this rock isn't in the official repository.  Rather,
do this:

  luarocks --from=geoip.luaforge.net/rocks install geoip

To compile and link, libGeoIP has to be installed including the .so file
and the headers.  In Debian, this is available in the libgeoip-dev package,
so you could do this first:

  apt-get install libgeoip-dev

Otherwise you could build libGeoIP from source which is available from
MaxMind's websiteb [2].



Usage
-----

First, load the library, which returns a table with two functions:

 geoip = require"geoip"
 g = geoip.open_type"country"
 g = geoip.open"/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"

The "open_type" function lets libGeoIP select the correct path and filename
for the desired database type, while "open" takes a file name and opens it.
Which type of data is contained in the file is detected automatically in
both cases.

The object returned by either open function provides just one method, lookup.

 r = g:lookup("74.125.67.100")
 r = g:lookup("google.com")

Either an IP address can be given, or a hostname, which is converted to an
IP address first.  Both functions either return nil on error or a result
object.

This result object can be used in the following ways:

  - convert it to a string, e.g. print(r)
  - retrieve an individual field, e.g. print(r.country_code)
  - iterate over the fields: for f, v in r do print(f, v) end
